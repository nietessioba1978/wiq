## What is a Three Point Thesis Statement?

A Three Point Thesis Statement is a tool used to clearly outline the main argument or position of your paper. It sets the stage for the entire document and helps guide the reader through your reasoning. The three points in this type of thesis statement typically address the key arguments or elements of your paper.

For example, a thesis statement could be: _"The increasing dependence on social media has negatively impacted society by reducing face-to-face communication, creating unrealistic beauty standards, and increasing levels of mental health issues."_ In this case, the three points are: 1) reduced face-to-face communication, 2) unrealistic beauty standards, and 3) increased mental health issues.
